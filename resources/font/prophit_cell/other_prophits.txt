V5 Prophit

Instructions:


++ Prophit (CELL) ++

Optimum screen size is 19pt with anti-aliasing
off.  Intended for use at large sizes.

++ Prophit (DOT) ++

Intended for use at large sizes.  Works well
on screen set at 29pt, with anti-aliasing off.

Notes:

1. All memebers of the Prophit family work
much better set in all-caps.

Usage:  This is a free font--you may use 
this and other V5 fonts at will.  It may not 
be sold, altered, or improperly credited,
however.  All I ask is that you kindly inform 
me if you find this font useful, and where
